# Summary

This is a remix of ridercz's Parametric Customizable Fruit Fly Trap. I have a set of small canning jars which I would like to fit with this lid.

Please note, both this and the original have a gotcha in the parameters. The lid_inner_diameter (measured in millimeters) is not the final diameter of the part, for that you need to add lid_inner_diameter + ( 2 * wall_thickness ). This wasn't obvious the first time I printed and the final part was too large. Also, this remix cuts the wall thickness in half compared to the original, so this isn't as large of an issue.

## Original summary
Thingiverse is full of fruit fly traps. But I haven't been able to find any that would match the jar I have. So I created one design, which is fully customizable. The most important parameter is of course the diameter, but you can change also the cone options if you wish.

## Changes from original

  * Clean up the model if a lip around the edge isn't desired.
    * If the inner height of the lid is specified as 0, the lip is not modeled (fixing a rendering issue)
  * Print faster, will less material, and with a cleaner print of the cone.
    * Wall thickness has been reduced by 50% from 1.6 to 0.8.
    * Printing at 0.16 resolution with a 0.4 nozzle this results in a wall that is 4 passes thick (2 inner and 2 outer walls without infill).
  * Enlarged the small hole at the bottom of the cone
    * We have commercially made traps with larger holes and the printer initially had an issue with the smaller hole (back when the model had thicker walls) so I doubled the size of the hole to 3mm.
  * Add multiple cones, hopefully to catch more files
